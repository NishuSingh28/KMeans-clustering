# KMeans-clustering

K-Means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm. There is no labeled data for this clustering, unlike in supervised learning. K-Means performs the division of objects into clusters that share similarities and are dissimilar to the objects belonging to another cluster. 

### Objective and result:
Implemented a purchase intent analysis using K-Means Clustering Algorithm to identify user retention likeliness based on user search duration and bounce rate vectors. UtiliSed the Elbow Curve technique to identify the optimal clustering and achieved RI Index of 0.893.
